# Soundboard

A Linux audio soundboard application with virtual microphone support for Discord, games, and other voice applications. The shell script can work entirely on it's own with xbind keys. (create directory>drop in soundboard.sh with some .mp3 files>navigate to directory with terminal and run the shell script or alias it in .bashrc) The GUI is just a frontend to immediately/conveniently play sounds that haven't been bound to a key, or switch around keybinds without typing. The GUI is setup to always default the stop command to 0 on the numpad (KP_0). Running just the shell, the stop command can be bound to anything. Had problems with binding special characters doing weird stuff and forgetting that 0 should be stop, so I hard coded it into the GUI.

## Troubleshooting
I recommend installing helvum pipewire patchbay if you run into weird audio issues. 
## Quick Start

### Download and Run
1. Download the latest `Soundboard-x86_64.AppImage` from [Releases](../../releases)
2. Make it executable: `chmod +x Soundboard-x86_64.AppImage`
3. Run it: `./Soundboard-x86_64.AppImage`

### First Setup
1. Click **Setup** to create virtual microphone
2. Add your audio files to `~/soundboard/` directory
4. Click **Scan** again to update the sound list and generate config
5. In Discord/apps, select "SB-Microphone" as your input device

## Usage

### GUI Controls
- **Left Click** - Play sound to headphones and virtual microphone
- **Middle Click + Key** - Bind sound to a keyboard key
- **Right Click** - Unbind a sound
- **Setup** - Create virtual microphone setup
- **Shutdown** - Put away the virtual audio setup and xbindtools (cleanup+free your keys from being bound)
- **Scan** - Find new audio files

### Command Line
After running the AppImage once, alias /home/[user]/soundboard/soundboard.sh in your .bashrc to use terminal commands:
```bash
soundboard                    # List all sounds
soundboard scan              # Scan for new audio files
soundboard setup             # initialize virtual audio devices
soundboard 5                 # Play sound #5 to headphones
soundboard 5 mic             # Play sound #5 to virtual microphone
soundboard 5 both            # Play sound #5 to both outputs
soundboard bind 5 KP_1       # Bind sound #5 to Numpad 1
soundboard stop              # Stop all sounds
soundboard volume 75         # Set local volume to 75%
soundboard cleanup           # Remove virtual microphone
```

### Audio Setup
The soundboard creates these virtual audio devices:
- **SB-Microphone** - Select this as input in Discord/games
- **Soundboard-Output** - Controls what others hear
- **Soundboard-Headphones** - Controls what you hear locally
